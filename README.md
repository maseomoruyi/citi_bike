A presentation showing analysis using Advanced Excel on citi bank dataset. This was completed from the career foundry 'Data Analysis for Beginners' free course.  

For this project, I solely used Excel.  I started by cleaning my dataset by removing duplicates and blanks. I then went on to exploratory data analysis and descriptive statistics.
I made use of different functions including AVERAGE, MIN, MAX functions. I then used Pivot Tables to answer the questions.
